## PHP NOTES
The documentation on PHP is better than what I can provide, use the documentation as a self guide.


## VERY IMPORTANT NOTES
If you are on Linux you should have a basic understanding of how to install dependencies,
Setting them up on the other hand I cannot help you with as I do not have a basic understanding of Linux,
And for me to give guides I need a basic understanding of said operating system, 
I will **NOT** give guides to an operating system I do not understand because it's not 100% guaranteed is going to be right.
